# Shodan-mattermost

Based on this project, you will be able to create a simple [Slash command](https://docs.mattermost.com/developer/slash-commands.html) to use in Mattermost (and maybe in Slack too) for [Shodan.io](https://www.shodan.io/). 

### Preview

Pro-tip: *For a quick overview, you can spin up a Mattermost Preview instance using Docker (Link to the [Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mattermost/mattermost-preview/)).*

```bash
docker run --name mattermost-preview -d --publish 8065:8065 mattermost/mattermost-preview
```

The instance is then accessible at: *http://0.0.0.0:8065*

### Installation

As soon as your Mattermost instance is up and running, you should go to the System console and enable Custom Slack Commands.

Then, go to Menu > Integrations > Custom Slash Command.

![Creating a Custom Slash command](https://github.com/PaulSec/Shodan-mattermost/blob/master/files/create_slash_command.png?raw=true)

Fill in the information regarding your Slash command appropriately.

Your Slash command has now been created.

Make sure that you copy token generated by Mattermost and edit respectively both tokens (Shodan and Mattermost ones) in *mattershodan.py*.

```python
SHODAN_API_KEY = "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
MATTERMOST_TOKEN = "YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY"
```

### Usage

Launch your web server: 


```bash
✗ python mattershodan.py
Starting matterslash server, use <Ctrl-C> to stop
```

And finally you can start typing your commands in the Mattermost Channel of your choice, like: 

```
/shodan_search_host 115.203.10.170
```
